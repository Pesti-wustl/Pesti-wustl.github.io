        <h1>The Common Core</h1>
        <h3>Many parents have been stumped at some of the teaching methods and strategies that the common core standard has put into primary education. Here are some of the examples - try and answer them for yourself and see if you're right!</h3>

        <h2>Question 1:</h2>
        <p>Jaunita wants to give bags of stickers to her friends. She wants to give the same numbers of stickers to each friend.
            She's not sure if she needs 4 bags or 6 bags of stickers. How many stickers could she buy so there are no stickers
            left over?
        </p>
        <label for="answer-1">Answer:</label>
        <input type="text" name="" id="question-1">
        <button id="Submit-1">Submit</button>
        <div class="Submit-1 answer">The least common multiple of 4 and 6 - which is 12. This question has become infamous due to its confusing wording.</div>

        <h2>Question 2:</h2>
        <p>What values should be entered in bubbles to complete the "number bond"</p>

        <input type="text" name="" id="question-2">
        <button id="Submit-2">Submit</button>
        <div class="Submit-2 answer">
            <p>The Answer would be (4, 4). Reason being it is easier to visualize the addition of 6 + 8 by imagining the number 8 as 4 + 4, and then using those two numbers to add to 6. (6 + 4 = 10, then 10 + 4 = 14)</p>
            <p>"Number bonds" have been one of the most controversial methods of the common core standard</p>
        </div>



        <h2>Question 3:</h2>
        <p>Subtract 38 from 325 using the "counting up method". Write the smaller number, 38, and count up to 325. Circle each number
            that you count up
        </p>

        <div class="Submit-3 answer">
            Here is the solution that uses the "counting up method." Many parents have been frustrated by this method and find it hard to help their children when it is on their homework.

        <h2>Question 4:</h2>
        <p>Jack used the number line below to solve 427 - 316. Find his error. Then write a letter to Jack
            telling him what he did rihgt, and what he should do to fix his mistake.

            <p>This is probably the most famous "confusing common core problem." It became viral when an angry father posted this on Facebook</p>

            <p>The solution is that after Jack counted down by 6 he forgot to count back by ten one more time (thus getting 121 instead of 111)</p>

        <h2>Question 5:</h2>
        <p>Felix made 8 birthday invitations with hearts. He made some more with stars. How many 
            invitations had hearts?
